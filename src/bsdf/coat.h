/**
 * 'Arbitrarily Layered Micro-Facet Surfaces'
 * http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.160.2363&rep=rep1&type=pdf
 *
 * This BRDF is a simplified version of the above mentioned work. Only one layer of coating is supported.
 * The coating layer is hard-coded with Microfacet BRDF model, which is not configurable. However, the underlying layer could be configurable by attaching 
 * other BXDF. If nothing is attached, a 'null' material, which is totally based will be at the bottome.
