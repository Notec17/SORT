//! @brief K-Dimensional Tree or KD-Tree.
/**
 * A KD-Tree is a spatial partitioning data structure for organizing primitives in
 * a k-dimensional space. In the context of a ray tracer, k usually equals to 3.
 * KD-Tree is a very popular spatial data structure for accelerating ray tracing
 * algorithms and it is also one of the most efficient ones.
 * The construction of this KD-Tree works in O(N*lg(N)), which is proved to be the
 * optimal solution in one single thread.
 * Please refer to this paper
 * <a href="http://www.eng.utah.edu/~cs6965/papers/kdtree.pdf">
 * On building fast kd-Trees for Ray Tracing, and on doing that in O(N log N)</a> for further details.
