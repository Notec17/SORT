/**
 * Accelerator is an interface rather than a base class. There is no instance of it.
 * It is responsible for acceleration of intersection tests between ray and primitives.
 * A ray tracing algorithm without a spatial acceleration structure is O(M*N) where M is
 * the number of rays and N is the number of primitives. Spatial acceleration structure
 * can optimize the algorithm so that it is O(M*lg(N)), a significant improvement over
 * the naive brute force ray tracing.
 * Common spatial structures inlcudes, KD-Tree, BVH and Uniform Grid.
