//			are parsed from file and located in a single pool. And it's 
//			responsible for deallocate all of the material memory.
//	note :	There will be textuers in most of materials. when materials are
//			deleted the bind texture is also deleted. In another words ,
//			material system is also responsible for deallocating textures.
