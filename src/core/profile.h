// SORT used to use this profiler as default one.
// It is a open-source cross-platform project, which is available on git https://github.com/yse/easy_profiler
// However, it doesn't scale well with billions of rays, for which reason, this feature is dropped.

// Seeking more affordable implementation. And the task-based graph is not as useful as it is in real time rendering
// because it is all very similar task for every ray. A random sampling profiler may be more suitable for this project.
// Here is the Github issue tracking the feature
// https://github.com/JerryCao1985/SORT/issues/69
