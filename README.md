# SORT

## Introduction
SORT, short for Simple Open-source Ray Tracing, is my personal cross platform ray tracing renderer. It is a standalone ray tracing program, while works well in Blender as a renderer plugin. Simliar to other open source ray tracer, like PBRT, luxrenderer, SORT is also a physically based renderer. However, since it is a solo project that I worked on in my spare time, it is way simpler comparing with its peers.

## Features

Here are the features implemented so far:
  - Integrator. (Whitted ray tracing, direct lighting, path tracing, light tracing, bidirectional path tracing, instant radiosity, ambient occlusion)
  - Spatial acceleration structure. (KD-Tree, BVH, Uniform grid, OcTree)
  - BXDF. (Lambert, Oran Nayar, MicroFacet Reflection, Microfacet Refraction, MERL, Fourier, AshikhmanShirley)
  - Node graph based material system.
  - Camera. (DOF)
  - Multi-thread rendering.
  - Blender plugin.
